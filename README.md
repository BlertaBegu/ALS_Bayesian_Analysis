# ALS Bayesian Analysis

(Authors: Blerta Begu, Daniele Ceccarelli and Massimiliano Riva)

The aim of this project is to study ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) Progression with a Bayesian approach. We are using the PRO-ACT
database (https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT) 

## ALSFRS
We want to study the progression of the disease in terms of ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Score - Rev), that is a score used by doctors to evaluate ALS of a patient with 12 questions, rated from 0 to 4, for a maximum of 48 points.
The questions want to evaluate the functionality of different part of the body: more info at (https://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/ALS/sf12.aspx#scale).
