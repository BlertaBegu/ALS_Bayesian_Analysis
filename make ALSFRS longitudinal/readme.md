#Make Alsfrs longitudinal

Transform the score ALSFRS to be used in our longitudinal analysis and compute it in three different ways:
- Normal ALSFRS
- ALSFRS-R (in addiction to the previous one, it has 2 more question about respiratory problems)
- ALSFRS-R complete (Since most of the patients have only one of the previously scores, we compute the second from the first just adding twice the Q10)
